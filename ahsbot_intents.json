The performance should be more than adequate for the majority of use case scenarios.It is much easier to learn, less code is required to implement functionality and therefore also easier to maintain long term.\nFor those requiring the highest level of performance e.g. algorithmic trading - they should consider ETA.\nFor a high level overview of EMA please refer them to article Introduction to Elektron Message API(https://developers.refinitiv.com/article/introduction-elektron-message-api) as well as the Elektron SDK page https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/elektron."],
